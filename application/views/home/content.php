Amongst University of London multi-faculty colleges, Queen Mary was ranked fourth, 10 places ahead of King's College London, which was ranked 22nd in the country.</p><p>As a member of the 1994 Group of research-focused universities, Queen Mary has made a strategic commitment to the highest quality of research. We have invested in this principle through a systematic programme of recruiting to Queen Mary the best academic staff in their disciplines from around the world.</p><h2>Our London setting</h2><p>Alongside our global research excellence, we have a strong commitment to our London environment. Queen Mary spans London's diverse districts. Two of our four campuses are in east London, in the Borough of Tower Hamlets between The City and Canary Wharf, a multicultural and socially diverse area that is one of the most rapidly developing parts of London. We have the advantage of being the London research-focused university closest to the site of the 2012 Olympic Games, only two miles from the Mile End site, our main residential campus. <a title="" href="http://www.qmul.ac.uk/about/howtofindus/whitechapel/index.html">Whitechapel</a> is home to part of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smd.qmul.ac.uk/">Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry</a>, focused on the stunning Will Alsop Blizard Building, housing the largest open plan laboratories in Europe.</p><p>Our other campuses are in central London: at <a title="" href="http://www.qmul.ac.uk/about/howtofindus/charterhouse/index.html">Charterhouse Square</a> and Barts Hospital, on the edge of the City of London, the key financial district, one of the two campuses of Barts and The London Medical School; and at <a title="" href="http://www.qmul.ac.uk/about/howtofindus/lif/index.html">Lincoln's Inn Fields</a>, in London's Legal District, the home for our Graduate <a target="_blank" href="http://www.law.qmul.ac.uk/">School of Law</a> and the world-famous <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ccls.qmul.ac.uk/">Centre for Commercial Law Studies</a>.</p><p>See more about <a title="" href="http://www.qmul.ac.uk/about/howtofindus/index.html">How to find us</a>.</p><h2>Our international strategy</h2><p>We offer two <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elec.qmul.ac.uk/international/JointDegreeProgrammes.htm">Joint Degree Programmes</a> to a projected population of 2,000 students in Beijing, in collaboration with our close partners, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), the first such programmes to be approved by the Chinese Ministry of Education. These programmes are a key component of our comprehensive International Strategy, which is focused around the concepts of partnership and a sustainable involvement in a range of countries around the world, as well as the value we place on our 2,800 international students.</p><h2>Our rich history</h2><p>Queen Mary has its roots in four historic colleges: Queen Mary College, Westfield College, St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College and the London Hospital Medical College.</p><p>The <a title="" href="http://www.qmul.ac.uk/about/howtofindus/mileend/index.html">Mile End</a> campus is historically the home of Queen Mary College, which began life in 1887 as the People's Palace, a philanthropic endeavour to provide east Londoners with education and social activities. It was admitted to the University of London in 1915.</p><p>Westfield College was founded in 1882 as a pioneering college for the higher education of women, and was granted its Royal Charter in 1932. In 1995, Queen Mary and Westfield merged with two distinguished medical colleges, St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College, established in 1843, and the London Hospital Medical College, England's first medical school, founded in 1785. Pooling strengths, expertise and resources, this brought clinical medical teaching to Queen Mary for the first time. Queen Mary is now fully integrated.</p><h2>Our link with the University of London</h2><p>Although the size and diversity of Queen Mary gives it all the characteristics and facilities of a university in its own right, it is also part of the federal University of London, a wide-ranging body comprising some 40 academic institutions and 120,000 students. Together, these make it the largest and most diverse university in the country. It also means that, although Queen Mary is a self-governing institution, our students are able to take advantage of the wide and varied educational and social facilities of the University of London. These include the Senate House library, which contains more than 1.4 million volumes, and the University of London Union (ULU), which is amongst the most active and lively in the country.</p>
